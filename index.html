           <h3 id="headline">Here is a timeline of Visionary Steve Jobs:</h3>
           <ul>
               <li><strong>1955</strong>- Steven Paul Jobs is born in San Francisco to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali. The then-unmarried couple give up their son to adoption. Paul and Clara Jobs become Jobs' non-biological parents.</li>
               <li><strong>1968</strong>- Jobs calls Bill Hewlett, the co-founder and co-namesake of Hewlett-Packard, looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter. Hewlett gives Jobs the parts, as well as an internship with the company that summer.</li>
               <li><strong>1974</strong>- Begins a brief stint as an engineer at Atari. Working the night shift, he employs Wozniak to help whittle down the hardware required for a prototype of a single-player version of Pong, the game that would go on to become Breakout. Jobs leaves Atari in the summer to travel through India, only to return to California to live in a commune.</li>
               <li><strong>1976</strong>- o-founds Apple Computer with Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. That same year, the company sells the Apple I in the form of a kit that sells for $666.66.</li>
               <li><strong>1977</strong>- Releases the Apple II, the first commercially available personal computer in a plastic case with color graphics--and Apple's first successful personal computer.</li>
               <li><strong>1984</strong>- Two days after the $1.5 million Ridley Scott-directed "1984" Super Bowl commercial airs, introduces the Macintosh to much fanfare during Apple's shareholder meeting. "For the first time ever, I'd like to let Macintosh speak for itself." The computer's voice then says, "Never trust a computer you can't lift." Macintosh becomes the first commercially successful small computer with a graphical user interface.</li>
               <li><strong>1986</strong>- For $10 million, buys the Graphics Group division of Lucasfilm that becomes Pixar Animation Studios.</li>
               <li><strong>1988</strong>- NeXT Computer releases its first computer.</li>
               <li><strong>1998</strong>- Introduces the iMac, which becomes commercially available in August.</li>
               <li><strong>2001</strong>- Introduces iTunes, then exclusively for Mac users. "iTunes is miles ahead of every other jukebox application, and we hope its dramatically simpler user interface will bring even more people into the digital music revolution."</li>
               <li><strong>2001</strong>-  Introduces the iPod:"With iPod, Apple has invented a whole new category of digital music player that lets you put your entire music collection in your pocket and listen to it wherever you go...With iPod, listening to music will never be the same again." Apple's shipped more than 300 million iPods as of October 2011.</li>
               <li><strong>2004</strong>- Jobs undergoes surgery to remove a cancerous tumor in his pancreas.</li>
               <li><strong>2006</strong>- That year, Apple's market capitalization surpasses Dell's.</li>
               <li><strong>2007</strong>- Drops "Computer" from Apple's name. Introduces the iPhone: "iPhone is a revolutionary and magical product that is literally five years ahead of any other mobile phone...We are all born with the ultimate pointing device--our fingers--and iPhone uses them to create the most revolutionary user interface since the mouse." Apple owns 19.1 percent of the smartphone market as of August 2011, having shipped 108 million iPhones worldwide as of March 2011.</li>
               <li><strong>2011</strong>- Dies at age of 56.</li>
            </ul>
